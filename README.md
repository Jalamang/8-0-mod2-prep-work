# Prep for Module 2 by Reinforcing What You Learned in Module 1

We're heading into Module 2 in just a few days! If you feel you could use more practice with the concepts we've covered in Module 1, now is the perfect time to strengthen your foundations.

## Getting started

Fork and clone this repository.

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

`npm install`
This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

## Tests

To run the tests both files, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your local directory.

`npm test`
This will run the test output once.

To run _just_ the level 1 tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your local directory.

`npm test level-1`
This will run the test output once.

To run _just_ the level 2 tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your local directory.

`npm test level-2`
This will run the test output once.

## Test watcher

If you'd like, you can have the tests run constantly. This means that each time you save your file, your tests will re-run. To do so, you can run the following:

`npm run watch`
Follow the on-screen prompts to exit out of the constant runner.

## Run file

If you want to manually test out one of your files, you can do so by running one of the following commands.

`node src/level-1-building-blocks.js`

OR

`node src/level-2-more-complex-problems.js`

The output will be printed to your terminal.
